        <h2><li>Release the Brake Tension</li></h2>
        <p>The brake pads are held close to the metal rim for extra stopping power by tension on the brake cable. The limited clearance between brake pads and the tire will prevent wheel removal. You can release the tension and widen the breaks by adjusting the lever on the dual pivot breaks.</p>
        <p class="green">As you adjust the lever, pay attention to the clearance between brake pads and the rim. You can see the swing cause by the lever, and will know when the brakes are in proper position.</p>

        <h2><li>Undo the Wheel Retention Device</li></h2>
        <p>Compression between the wheel's axle and bike's fork holds the wheel firmly in the fork's dropouts. <span class="green">(Refer to the <a href="G.html">glossary</a> if these terms are unfamiliar.)</span> You can undo the compression by pulling down the "quick release lever". After the lever has been released, thread the axle in the counter-clockwise direction to further loosen it.</p>
        <p class="red">Warning! The Bike is not safe to ride without brakes or a wheel retention device. Please refer to <a href="5.html">Step Five</a> to reconfigure the wheel.</p>
        <h2><li>Removing the Wheel from the Dropouts</li></h2>
        <p>The front or rear wheel can now be easily pulled out of the bike's fork.</p> 
        <p>For the front wheel: lift the frame off of the ground and press down on the top of the wheel. It will fall free.</p>
        <p class="red">Warning! If you are removing the rear wheel, ensure the chain is in the smallest rear gear and largest front gear. Doing so will prevent the chain from becomig tangled or twisted during removal.</p>
        <p>For the rear wheel: Use your hand to release the chain tension by pulling back on the rear derailleur. This will disengage the chain from your rear cassette, and allow the wheel to fall free.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.png" alt="placeholder" class="center">
        <p class="red">Warning! Do not try to balance the bike frame on the front dropouts or rear casette. Instead, place the bike upside down like the figure below to prevent damage to components.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.png" alt="placeholder" class="center">
        <p>If the wheel and frame are seperated entirely you are ready for Step Two!</p>
