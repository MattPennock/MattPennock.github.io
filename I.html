      <p>Biking in State College is a joy! The combination of bike racks, paths and friendly legislation makes transportation a breeze. However, a flat can ruin the day. With experience, changing a bike flat takes no more than ten minutes, and is essential knowledge for any cyclist. This tutorial will walk you through the major steps involved with replacing a punctured tube.</p>

      <p>Things you will need:
        <ul>
          <li>Replacement Tube</li>
          <li>Tire Levers</li>
          <li>Bike Pump</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Steps Involved:
        <ol>
          <li>Removing the Wheel from the Frame</li>
          <p>First, the entire wheel must be detached from the bike's fork. This involves releasing the brake tension and wheel retention device so the wheel may freely fall off the bike.</p>
          <li>Removing the Punctured Tube from the Wheel</li>
          <p>The tube that holds air is wrapped in a tire secured to the rim. This step will seperate rim, tube and tire.</p>
          <li>Visual Inspection</li>
          <p>Often, the metal shard or thorn that punctured the tube remains embedded in the tire. This step will identify the location of the puncture and remove any particles from the wheel that may cause another flat.</p>
          <li>Replacing the Tube</li>
          <p>Now that the rim and wheel are prepared for a new tube, we will inflate the replacement and reassemble the wheel.</p>
          <li>Reassembly</li>
          <p>The wheel, breaks and retention device will be properly reconfigured to safely hold your fully inflated wheel inplace.</p>
        </ol>
      </p>
